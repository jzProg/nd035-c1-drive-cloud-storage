# Super*Duper*Drive
My implementation of the final assessment project for Udacity's Java Web Developer Nanodegree Spring Boot Basics course.

## Description
A Cloud Storage based application, like Google Drive and Dropbox. Features:

1. **Simple File Storage:** Upload/download/remove files
2. **Note Management:** Add/update/remove text notes
3. **Password Management:** Save, edit, and delete website credentials.

## Requirements and Roadmap
Your tech lead is excited to work with you and has laid out a development roadmap with requirements and milestones. They tell you that there are three layers of the application you need to implement:

1. The back-end with Spring Boot
2. The front-end with Thymeleaf
3. Application tests with Selenium
